# Project Title: College Students' Sleep Patterns Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the sleep patterns of college students using a dataset comprising information from 253 students. The dataset covers various variables such as gender, class year, sleep preferences, academic metrics, mental health scores, happiness, alcohol use, bedtime, rise time, and sleep duration on weekdays and weekends. The dataset also records instances of all-nighters, providing a comprehensive overview of college students' sleep, lifestyle choices, and mental well-being.

## Research Questions
- Is there a significant difference in the average GPA between male and female college students?
- Is there a significant difference in the average number of early classes between the first two class years and other class years?
- Do students who identify as “larks” have significantly better cognitive skills compared to “owls”?
- Is there a significant difference in the average number of classes missed between students with at least one early class and those who don’t?
- Is there a significant difference in the average happiness level between students with at least moderate depression and normal depression status?
- Is there a significant difference in average sleep quality scores between students who reported having at least one all-nighter and those who didn’t?
- Do students who abstain from alcohol use have significantly better stress scores than those who report heavy alcohol use?
- Is there a significant difference in the average number of drinks per week between students of different genders?
- Is there a significant difference in the average weekday bedtime between students with high and low stress?
- Is there a significant difference in the average hours of sleep on weekends between first two year students and other students?

## Methodology
The analysis is conducted using the R programming language. Statistical techniques, including t-statistics, confidence intervals, and p-values, are employed to derive meaningful insights. Visualization is facilitated through ggplot, providing clear representations of the data.

## Summary of Findings
### The analysis reveals several insights into college students' sleep patterns:

Gender differences in GPA were not statistically significant, with a slight variation favoring female students.
Early classes significantly impact class attendance, highlighting the importance of scheduling considerations.
Sleep preferences (larks or owls) did not show a strong correlation with cognitive skills.
Depression status significantly influences happiness levels, emphasizing the interplay between mental well-being and emotional states.
All-nighters showed no statistically significant impact on sleep quality, but students without all-nighters tended to have better sleep quality.
Heavy alcohol use correlated with higher stress scores, indicating the potential impact of lifestyle choices on stress levels.
In summary, the study provides insights into the interconnectedness of sleep, mental health, and lifestyle choices for college students, shedding light on how these factors collectively influence overall well-being.
